Using JavaScript to create financial analysis

## Description

Using JavaScript for real world issues. With this challenge I set out to create code for analyzing financial records for a company. I built this code because I wanted to find out the total number of months in the provided dataset, the net total amount of profit/loses over the entire period, the average of the changes over the entire period, the greatest increase in profits and the greastest decrease in losses. This not only helps me solidify my understanding of what I have learnt so far in the course, but helps me develop a growth mindset when running into issues. This further helps me show my skills with real world problems so the future employers can see, first-hand how I can help them as a company. By solving this problem, I have been able to show all of the skills I have learnt so far.

## Installation

To view this code, please follow the link above, you will see some simple HTML that will instruct you to open the console. To do that please right-click on the page, selcet 'inspect' and switch over to the console tab to see what the code in the index.js is doing.

## Usage

People can use this code to look at how I came to my conclusions and how I used JavaScript. They can also pull from this code to further help their understand for their own issues as I have set it out in a clear and concise way.
